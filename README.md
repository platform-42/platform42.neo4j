# platform42.neo4j - release 2.5.0

Ansible collection for managing **Neo4j graph databases**: create and update vertices (nodes), edges (relationships), constraints, execute queries, and clean up the database. This collection provides a declarative, idempotent interface to Neo4j, allowing automation of graph data management in a consistent and reliable way.

---

## Features

- **Vertex management (`vertex` module)**  
  Create or update nodes in the graph with specified labels and properties. Supports idempotent operations using Cypher `MERGE`.

- **Edge management (`edge` module)**  
  Create relationships between vertices with configurable direction, type, and properties. Also uses `MERGE` for idempotent updates.

- **Query execution (`query_read` and `query_write` modules)**  
  Run read-only or write Cypher queries against the graph. Supports parameterized queries and returns JSON-serializable results including summary statistics.

- **Database cleanup (`graph_reset`)**  
  Easily remove nodes, relationships, or entire datasets by executing Cypher commands in an automated, repeatable manner.

- **Constraint management (`constraint` module)**
  Define and enforce schema-level rules in the Neo4j database. Supports creating unique property constraints on nodes using Cypher CREATE CONSTRAINT … IF NOT EXISTS, ensuring data integrity and idempotent schema management.

- **Label management (`label` module)**
  Manage labels on existing Neo4j nodes declaratively through Ansible. This module allows you to add or remove labels on nodes, supporting idempotent operations via Cypher SET n:Label and REMOVE n:Label.

- **Statistics and diagnostics**  
  Each module returns detailed execution summaries (nodes/relationships created, deleted, properties set, etc.), enabling auditability and observability in automation pipelines.

## Installation

```bash
# Install Python Neo4j driver
pip3 install neo4j
pip3 install regex

# Install collection from Ansible Galaxy
ansible-galaxy collection install platform42.neo4j
```

The last step is not mandatory. 
It is to provide ansible-doc access to the document pages.
The playbooks that utilise this collection, always install it before usage.


## Usage

Ansible Neo4j collection can be used for both Cloud and localhost setups.
Only NEO4J_URI connection string is different.

```yaml

# vars/settings/cloud/settings.yml (AURA)
---
AURA_INSTANCEID: 123456789ABC
NEO4J_URI: "neo4j+s://{{ AURA_INSTANCEID }}.databases.neo4j.io"
NEO4J_USERNAME: neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD: ************
NEO4J_DATABASE: <project>|defaults to neo4j

# vars/settings/local/settings.yml (localhost)
---
NEO4J_URI: neo4j://127.0.0.1:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME: neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD: ************
NEO4J_DATABASE: <project>|defaults to neo4j

# put additional label Suspect on existing node with label Account
- name: "create Suspect label on Account:A4"
  platform42.neo4j.label:

    database: "{{ NEO4J_DATABASE }}"
    username: "{{ NEO4J_USERNAME }}"
    password: "{{ NEO4J_PASSWORD }}"
    base_label: Account
    entity_name: A4
    label: Suspect
    state: PRESENT
  register: suspect

#
# every module has identical response structure
# registered variable consists of:
#
#   var-name.
#     module-name.
#       cypher_query        -> cypher query with bindings (no values)
#       cypher_params       -> cypher values for bindings
#       cypher_query_inline -> cypher query with values (for debugging)
#       cypher_response     -> answer from Neo4j
#       stats               -> impact of the module on Neo4j
#
#   e.g.:
#    ----------------------------------------------
#     <register>  . <module-name> . <field>
#    ----------------------------------------------
#     station     . vertex        . cypher_query
#     track       . edge          . cypher_query
#     entity_name . constraint    . stats
#     suspect     . label         . cypher_response
#    ----------------------------------------------

## Neo4j properties

Neo4j properties are additional attributes that can be stored with a vertex or edge 
By default, Ansible translate all properties to string data type resulting in loss of type conext.

```yaml
# 
#   Consider this input YAML:
#     Internally, in amount is considered as a string
#     since our module needs to be abstract, we need to provide extra 
#     type information to cast the value correctly, without hardcoding it
#
properties:
  amount: 1200
  timestamp: "2025-10-02T09:00:00Z"
```

As a consequence a property must implement both `type` and `value`
`type` can be `str|int|float|bool|datetime`

```yaml
#
#   By splitting a property into a value and type, we can
#   provide a safe type cast inside the edge and vertex modules
#
properties:
  amount:
    value: 1200
    type: int
  timestamp:
    value: "2025-10-02T09:00:00Z"
    type: datetime
```
